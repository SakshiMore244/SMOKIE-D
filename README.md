# SMOKIE-D
• Smoke Detector using MQ-2 Gas Sensor, Arduino UNO, Embedded C language.
• Interfaced an Arduino to a MQ-2 gas sensor and developed the software to detect the smoke.
• Developed an rudimentary application using an Embedded System, Interpreted the features of real time operating system.
• You will read the sensor analog output voltage and when the smoke reaches a certain level, it will make sound a buzzer and a red LED will turn on.
• When the output voltage is below  that level, a green LED will be on.
• The voltage that the sensor outputs changes accordingly to the smoke/gas level that exists in the atmosphere. 
• The sensor outputs a voltage that is proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas.
• In other words, the relationship between voltage and gas concentration is the following:
The greater the gas concentration,the greater the output voltage
The lower the gas concentration,the lower the output voltage
